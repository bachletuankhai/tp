### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API**:
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the contact list data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo feature is implemented using the following components:

- `ReverisbleCommand` interface. This interface defines two methods:

    - `ReversibleCommand#undo(Model model)`— Reverts the command and returns a `CommandResult`.
    - `ReversibleCommand#redo(Model model)`— Re-executes the command and returns a `CommandResult`.

  `ReversibleCommand` interface is used in conjunction with the abstract `Command` class. Commands that support
  undo/redo
  implement this interface.

- `CommandHistoryManager` class. This class is responsible for managing the undo/redo history. It maintains 2 lists
  of `ReversibleCommand` objects: `history` and `future`.

    - `history` contains the commands that have been executed and can be undone. New commands are added to the end of
      the list.
    - `future` contains the commands that have been undone and can be redone.

   <br>
   `CommandHistoryManager` provides the following methods:

    - `CommandHistoryManager#addCommand(ReversibleCommand command)`— Adds a command to the `history` list and clears
      the `future` list.
    - `CommandHistoryManager#getCommandToUndo(Model model)`— Returns the last command in the `history` list and moves it
      to the end of the `future` list.
    - `CommandHistoryManager#getCommandToRedo(Model model)`— Returns the last command in the `future` list and moves it
      to the end of the `history` list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface
as `Model#addCommand(ReversibleCommand)`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. The `CommandHistoryManager` is initialized with empty `history`
and `future` lists.

**Step 2.** The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#addCommand(ReversibleCommand)` to add the itself to the `history` list.

![Add "delete 5" to history](images/UndoRedoAddCommandObjectDiagram.png)

**Step 3.** The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also
calls `Model#addCommand(ReversibleCommand)` to add itself to the `history` list.

![Add "add n/David" to history](images/UndoRedoAddCommandObjectDiagram2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addCommand(ReversibleCommand)`, so the command will not be added to the `history` list. This ensures that only successful commands are added to the history.

</div>

**Step 4.** The user decides to undo the `add n/David …​` command by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command
calls `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which retrieves the last command from the `history` list and
calls `ReversibleCommand#undo(Model model)` on it. The add command is removed from the `history` list and added to
the `future` list.

![Undo "add n/David"](images/UndoRedoUndoCommandObjectDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `history` list is empty, there is no command to undo.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo. Similarly, the `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if the `future` list is empty.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command is similar — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which retrieves the last command from the `future`
list and calls `ReversibleCommand#redo(Model model)` on it.

**Step 5.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the data, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#addCommand()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `history` list remains unchanged.

![Undo "add n/David"](images/UndoRedoUndoCommandObjectDiagram.png)

**Step 6.** The user executes `delete 1`, which calls `Model#addCommand(ReversibleCommand)`. The `future` list, which
contains the previous `add n/David...` command, is cleared.
Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command, since `delete 1` may affect the added person.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![Add "delete 1" to history](images/UndoRedoAddCommandObjectDiagram3.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="200" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book.

    - Pros: Easy to implement.
    - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 4

1. **Add Confirmation Dialog for Delete Event**:
    - **Feature Flaw**: Currently, when a user executes the "delete event" command, the event is immediately removed
      without any confirmation. This can lead to accidental deletions.
    - **Proposed Fix**: Implement a confirmation dialog that prompts the user to confirm the deletion before proceeding.
      The dialog should display details of the event to be deleted and provide options to confirm or cancel the
      deletion.

2. **Implement restriction that events can only be added for the future for Add Event**:
    - **Feature Flaw**: Adding events with dates in the past might not be accurate as ideally hackathon organisers would
      want to schedule events in the future.
    - **Proposed Fix**: Introduce restrictions for the event date that can be specified in the add event command
    - **Example**: addevent en/meeting ed/30-12-2023 ec/staff will be considered invalid

3. **Proper undoing of deletion**:
   Currently, undoing a delete command adds the deleted person to the end of the contact list instead of their original
   position. This can be confusing for users who expect the undo operation to truely revert the deletion. We plan to
   re-implment the undo feature of the delete command to restore the deleted person to their original position in the
   contact list.

4. **Allow more flexible name for contact**:
   Currently, the name of a contact can only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces. We plan to allow more characters such as
   hyphens, periods, apostrophes, slashes, and commas in the name of a contact.

5. **Implement priority system when assigning a person into a random group with Group Command**:
   - **Feature Flaw**: Assigning a person to a totally random group might not be accurate as ideally hackathon would need groups with similar group sizes.
   - **Proposed Fix**: Implement a priority system where the group that have fewer members have higher priority

6. **Add an option to not include existing groups for GroupRandom Command**:
   - **Feature Flaw**: Currently, GroupRandom Command will be randomly assigning group numbers, that ranges from 1 to a certain number. This is not ideal for when a hackathon organiser wants to randomize a subset of the contacts without changing the existing groups.
   - **Proposed Fix**: Introduce an option to randomly assigning groups without modifying the existing group members.

7. **Add a way to reset comments for a person**:
   Currently, it is possible to remove the dialog mark for a person by setting the comment to default command "No comment provided."
   However, there is no way to remove the comment by commands. We plan to add a command to reset the comment for a person.
     
## **Appendix: Effort**

Our project involved the development of a comprehensive event management system, which presented several challenges and
required significant effort. Unlike AB3, which deals with only one entity type (persons), our project dealt with
multiple entity types (events, persons: participants, staffs, sponsors), making it more complex.

**Difficulty Level:**

- The project's difficulty level was moderate to high due to the need to handle multiple entity types and implement
  various features such as grouping, undoing/redoing and event commands.

**Challenges Faced:**

- One challenge was ensuring the system's robustness and reliability, especially when handling complex data interactions
  and user inputs.

- We had to consider various scenarios that could result in a not so friendly user-friendly experience.

**Effort Required:**

- The project required a significant amount of effort from both development and testing perspectives. Development
  involved designing and implementing features, handling data storage and retrieval, and ensuring smooth system
  operations.
- Testing efforts were extensive to ensure the system's functionality and reliability.

**Achievements:**

- Despite the challenges, we successfully developed a functional and robust event management system that meets the
  project requirements and provides a seamless user experience.
- Our achievements include implementing key features such as grouping, undo/redo commands, creating CSV file and event
  commands, as well as ensuring data integrity and system stability.
