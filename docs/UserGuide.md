### Navigating this User Guide

---

## Main features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets `[]` are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/1` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CATEGORY​]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/staff`, `c/sponsor` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- Some commands have aliases. Please refer to [Aliases](#aliases) for more
  information.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessageHackLink.png)

**Format:** `help`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Notes:**

`help` cannot be used in event window

</div>

### Adding a person : `add`

Adds a person to HackLink.

**Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL c/CATEGORY [g/GROUP]`

**Parameters:**

- `NAME`: Person's name. Only alphanumeric characters and spaces are allowed, and must contain at least 1 non-space
  character.
- `PHONE`: Person's phone number. Only digits are allowed and must be at least 3 digits long.
- `EMAIL`: Person's email.
- `CATEGORY`: Either Participant, Sponsor, or Staff.
- `GROUP` _(optional)_: Person's group number. Must be a **positive integer**.

**Aliases:**

- `ap`: add participant
- `as`: add sponsor
- `at`: add staff

  You can skip the `CATEGORY` parameter and the application will automatically assign the category based on the alias
  used.

**Examples:**

- `add n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com p/98765432 c/participant g/1`
- `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com p/1234567 c/sponsor g/3`
- `ap n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com p/98765432`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Notes about parameter format and behavior:**

- There should be no “/” in each parameter.

- There should be no contacts with the same information. 2 contacts are considered the same if they have the same
  **name** and any match in **phone number** or **email**. Names are case-sensitive, e.g. "Jason" and "jason" does not
  match.

- As `NAME` only allow alphanumeric characters and spaces, names like "Dr. Jean-Paul O'Brien" cannot be inserted. You
  can work around this by either removing them or replacing them with space, e.g. "Dr. Jean-Paul O'Brien" can be
  inserted as "Dr JeanPaul OBrien". For abbreviations like "s/o", you can use the full word "son of" instead.

- `CATEGORY` is case-insensitive, e.g. `c/participant` and `c/PARTICIPANT` will set the person inserted as a
  participant.

- If no `g/GROUP` is provided, the person will be assigned to default group 0 in the list.

- This app is designed for small hackathons, with around 500 participants. However, the maximum number of entries in the
  contact list is 2147483647. Please delete some contacts to add a new person if you reach the limit.

</div>

Update and edit participant contact details.

**Format:** `edit ID [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [g/GROUP]`

**Parameters:**

- `ID`: the index of the contact in the list. It should be a positive integer smaller than 2147483648.

**Aliases:** `ed`

**Example:** `edit 1 n/John Doe p/98765432`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Notes about parameter format and command constraints:**

- The constraint for each parameter is the same as in [`add` command](#adding-a-person--add).

- There should be at least one field to edit. (`edit 1` is invalid, `edit 1 n/John Doe` is valid)

- The edit command only supports editing name, phone, email, and group. You _cannot_ change a person's category with
  `edit` command. Change of role should be done by deleting the person and adding them again with the new role. This is
  to prevent accidental changes in the person's role.(e.g. changing a participant to a sponsor by mistake)

- As the maximum number of entries in the contact list is 2147483647, `ID` should be a positive integer smaller than
  2147483648.

</div>

### Grouping a person : `group`

Assigns a participant or a staff to a group.

**Format:** `group ID [GROUP_NUMBER]`

**Parameters:**

- `ID`: the index number of the person in the list.
- `GROUP_NUMBER` _(optional)_: the group number. Can be any positive integer. When none is provided, the selected person
  will be randomly assigned to an **existing** group. If there is no existing valid group in the list (non-zero), the group number must be provided.

- `group 1 3`

- Before<br>
  ![before group](images/beforeGroup.png)

- After executing `group 1 3`<br>
  ![img.png](images/afterGroup13.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes about command constraints:**

- You can only randomly assign a person to an **existing group**.

- When no group exist you _cannot_ randomly assign a person into a group.

- You can only group staff and participant, sponsor cannot be grouped.

- As the maximum number of entries in the contact list is 2147483647, the id should be a positive integer smaller than
  2147483648.

</div>

### Grouping randomly listed persons : `grouprandom`

Assigns a random group to each participant and staff that are currently listed.

**Format:** `grouprandom MAXIMUM_GROUP_SIZE`

**Example:**

- `comment 1 Allergic to peanuts`
  ![img.png](images/comment.png)

  The dialog icon appearing next to the person name indicates that they have a comment.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

- **Adding a new comment on a person will replace any comments they have.** The comment is not appended to the existing
  comment. This is to prevent the comment from becoming too long and unreadable. Also it ensures that the comment is
  up-to-date. Please write the overall comment in current state by considering the previous comments.

- **All commas in your comment will be automatically removed** when it is inserted into the application for
  compatibility with link command(csv exporting).

- The comment format does not restrict the use of special characters. However, some special characters that are not
  supported by the system might be displayed differently in the application. It is recommended to use only alphanumeric
  characters and common punctuation marks. Use of special characters is at your own risk.

- The comment is a section for taking your important notes about the person. It is not meant to be used as a
  full-detailed description or review of the person. If you need to store more information, consider using a separate
  document.

- As the maximum number of entries in the contact list is 2147483647, the id should be a positive integer smaller than
  2147483648.

- The default comment for a person without any assigned comment is `No comment provided.`

- There is no separate command to reset or delete a comment. You can always replace the existing comment with a new one
  by using the `comment` command, but if you still want to remove the dialog icon, you can manually remove it by setting
the comment to default comment `No comment provided.`

</div>

### Viewing comments : `view`

View comment of a specific contact

**Format:** `view ID`

**Parameter:**

- `ID`: the index of the contact in the list

**Example:** `view 1`
![img.png](images/viewComment.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**

- As the maximum number of entries in the contact list is 2147483647, the id should be a positive integer smaller than
  2147483648.

- If the person does not have a comment, you can still use the `view` command to check if they have a comment or not.
  The application will display the default comment 'No comment provided.'.

- As mentioned in comment command, commas in the comment might cause the csv file to be corrupted, so they are removed
  from your input.

- As mentioned in comment command, some special characters that are not supported by the system might be displayed
  differently in the application. It is recommended to use only alphanumeric characters and common punctuation marks
  when making comment. Use of special characters is at your own risk.

- `Redo` and `Undo` commands are not supported for `view` command.

### Locating persons by keywords : `find`

Finds persons who contain any of the given keywords.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]…`

- The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`

- Full text of a person is searched, i.e. their name, email, phone number, group number, category and comments if any.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

### Exporting selected people : `link`

Produce a csv file with selected contacts' information.(name, phone, email, and comment)
The csv file will be saved in the `selectedPeople` folder in the same directory as the `HackLink.jar` file, with the name
`list.csv`. If the folder does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

**Format:** `link ID [MORE_ID]…`

**Parameters:**

- `ID`, `MORE_ID`: index(es) of the selected contact(s)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes on parameter constraints:**

- The order of the ids does not matter.
- The ids should be positive integers and valid and in the list.
- The ids should be separated by a space.
- There should be no duplicate ids.

</div>

  be corrupted, so they are removed from your input. Avoid using commas.

- As mentioned in [`comment` command](#commenting-a-person--comment), some special characters that are not supported by
  the system might be displayed differently in the application. Some special characters and emojis might be displayed as
`??` in the csv file. It is recommended to use only alphanumeric characters and common punctuation marks when making comment. Use of special characters is at your own risk.

- Do not open the `list.csv` file while the application is running. The file should be closed to write to it. Opening
  the file while the application is running may cause errors.

- As the maximum number of entries in the contact list is 2147483647, the id should be a positive integer smaller than
  2147483648.

### Saving the data

HackLink data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save
manually.

### Editing the data file

HackLink data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**<br>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HackLink will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the HackLink to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if the value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Undo

You can undo the last **changes made to the contact list** by using `undo` command. This will revert the last command
that changed the data.

**Format:** `undo`

**Aliases:** `ud`

### Redo

You can redo the last command that was undone by using `redo` command.

**Format:** `redo`

**Aliases:** `rd`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** `undo` and `redo` currently are **not supported on event window**. This means that you
cannot use these commands to revert the changes made to the event list.

</div>

### Navigating to older commands

HackLink allows you to navigate to older commands using the up and down arrow keys. This feature is useful when you want
to repeat a command you have previously entered.

### Aliases

Aliases are shortcuts for commands. In each command, you can use the alias in place of the command word, unless
specified otherwise by the command. Please refer to each command details for the alias.<br>

**Example:**

- [Delete command](#removing-a-person--delete) has command word `delete` and alias `d`. `d 1` and `delete 1` both
  deletes the person at index 1.
- [Adding command](#adding-a-person--add) has command word `add` and alias `ap` for adding participant. You don't need
  to include participant parameter when using this alias for `add` command.<br>
  `add n/John e/john@mail.com p/84831193 c/participant` and `ap n/John e/john@mail.com p/84831193` both adds new
  participant
  named "John" with given information to the contact list.

### Shortcuts

Shortcuts are a way to quickly perform action from the keyboard. The available shortcuts are:

- `F1` : Opens the help window
- `F2` : Focus on the command box
- `F3` : Focus on the result box (to scroll up and down in case of overflow)
- `F4` : Focus on the list of contacts (to scroll up and down in case of overflow)

---

## Event window

Events are shown in a separate window. You can navigate to the event window by clicking on the Events menu in the
menubar.

An event window will appear with a list of events. You can add, delete, and find events in the event window. Note how
the app contains some sample data for the events.<br>
![Ui](images/toEventsWindowUpdated.png)

You can get back to the main window by clicking on the Back to Main on the menubar.<br>
![Ui](images/backToMain.png)

---

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous HackLink home folder.

---

## Warnings

1. **Invalid Command** : When a command format is incorrect or parameters are missing, the application will prompt the
   user with a warning message.
2. **Command Failure** : If the person specified for editing or removing does not exist in the database, the application
   should display a warning message indicating the failure.
3. **Invalid input for update** : If the input for editing a person's information is invalid, the application should
   display a warning message indicating the failure and provide guidance on the correct format.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. When **undoing a deletion** by `undo` command after a `delete` command, the restored contact may not appear at the
   same row and/or having the same ID as the original contact. Refer to the example below: <br>
   ![img.png](images/knownIssues_undo_pic1.png)
    - `delete 2` deletes the person with ID 2 ("Bernice Yu") in the contact list
      ![img.png](images/knownIssues_undo_pic2.png)
    - `undo` re-adds this person back to the list, but with a different ID (4 instead of 2)
      ![img.png](images/knownIssues_undo_pic3.png)
    - `delete 2` does not guarantee to delete the same person again <br>
      The suggested workaround is to use [`redo` command](#redo) to delete the same person again, or to search for that
      exact person using [`find` command](#locating-persons-by-keywords--find) and delete them.

---

## Tips

1. **Use Descriptive Command Names**: You are encouraged to use descriptive names when adding, updating, or removing
   participants. This makes it easier to identify and manage individuals within the application.
2. **Utilize the utility features**: The application provides utility features such as navigating to older commands,
   aliases, and shortcuts. These features can help you manage your data more efficiently.
